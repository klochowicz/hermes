## Note

This codebase is effectively a brute-force copy of the the [Splipy](https://github.com/SINTEF/Splipy) python lib, cherry-picked to do what we need while still remaining consistent with the source material. This is quite a bit of overkill for our purposes, so this will either be refined in the futre **or** a complete translation of the Splipy lib will be created as it's own crate. As such, this code should be considered transitional at best.
